# BreedingSimulator

## Overview
**BreedingSimulator** is a simulation tool built using [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/) to model genomics-informed breeding strategies for zoo populations.

By simulating different breeding strategies, BreedingSimulator provides insights into how various approaches impact genetic diversity, minimize inbreeding effects, and control the accumulation of deleterious alleles.

## Key Objectives
- **Simulate Zoo Population Genetics**: Model the population genetics of zoo animals under varying breeding regimes to assess effects on inbreeding, genetic diversity, and relatedness.
- **Genomics-Informed Breeding**: Leverage genomic data in simulations to make realistic breeding recommendations for maintaining or improving population health.

## Features
- **Customizable Breeding Regimes**: Test multiple breeding strategies, including random mating, minimizing relatedness, and minimizing both relatedness and genetic load.
- **Inbreeding and Relatedness Tracking**: Track inbreeding coefficients, relatedness, and genetic diversity across generations.

## Acknowledgments
BreedingSimulator is developed using the SLiM evolutionary simulation framework and was created in the context of a course on population genetics and dynamics for first-year master's students in molecular life sciences at the University of Lausanne.
